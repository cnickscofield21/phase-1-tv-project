# Phase 1 TV Project
## By Ben Tryon and Nick Scofield

### Pitch
We will create a clean and simple TV program page using TVMaze. This page will let users organize their viewing content in a simple, ad-free manner.

## User Stories
As a user, I should be able to:
- Search over a broad range of shows to find entertaining programming.
- Search over a broad range of actors whose work I admire.
- Create and manage a “Favorite Shows” list to make efficient use of my entertainment time.
- View and contribute to show ratings so others may find new content.

## Data Source(s)
- [TVMaze](https://www.tvmaze.com/api)
- local db.json

## Framework(s)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
